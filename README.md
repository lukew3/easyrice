# riceman
A tool for ricing. Adds the ability to use different settings for the same window manager. Also allows for setups to be easily shared.

## Install
The only install method right now is install from source. To do this, you can run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/lukew3/riceman.git
cd riceman
sudo make install
```

## Usage
Use `riceman copy-current` to copy your current setup and save it as a riceman setup. Once you have tweaked your setup config files to work seperately from any config files on your pc, you are ready to copy and upload your setup folder to share with others.

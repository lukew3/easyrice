Clean up comments, put them in todo list
Fix inconsistencies
Add ability to add custom .desktop entries to desktop environment manager
	You can have a seperate entry for each setup you want to use on a regular basis

Fix bad documentation
CLONE: check for double folder when pulled
Figure out a way to record and install dependencies for rice setups
Decide if setups should have README's automatically generated when they upload to github
UPLOAD: If github repo already exists, don't attempt to create a new repo. Instead, just add and commit current changes
INSTALL: Users should be able to use the install command to install a dependency on the users pc, then move the .config into the setups dotfile location

Requirements.txt
	Check function should check to make sure that all packages are recognized
		If a package is not recognized, the user should be given an alternate predicted title for the package, if that name is correct, the package name should be corrected.
	There might be a possibility that you could suggest requirements to add based on installed packages and you would just have to confirm that you want to save those requirements
		Show a numbered list of requirements that are common and are installed on your computer. Then type a list with numbers seperated by a space to save to requirements

It is probably important to be able to test your setup without regarding your previously installed packages.
	This can be achieved by creating a seperate user profile with no installed packages and then deleting that profile after testing

Might need a dependency requirement file that is only edited by the computer
	Holds the names of the packages that need to be installed in order for requirements to be installed

REMOVE: If the current active setup is about to be removed, inform the user and ask if they want to continue(y/n)
	Tell them how to set new active setup

On startup, config files should be replaced with setup config files.
	Config files should be replaced on close, but this is easier said than done

Add ability to transfer wallpaper and other assets

It seems that i3-gaps just removes i3
	Make sure this is the case and then remove i3 from requirements
	Maybe remove i3 if i3-gaps is found in requirements automatically
